# Hello-World
Hello, my name is Matthew Husted, you can call me Matt. This is my first use of GitHub, but I have known about it for a while now. I am an aspiring web developer with beginning experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. As a Mercer undergraduate student in the Informatics program, I am presently studying PHP and MySQL.

Although I currently working in technical software support, I hope to obtain a junior web developer position with a company in the next year and a half.
